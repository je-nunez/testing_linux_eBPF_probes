Testing the Linux kernel eBPF probes using the IOVisor BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)

# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and
subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# Required libraries

[Follow these instructions to install the required libraries](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

E.g., at least for Red Hat / Fedora, besides a Linux kernel newer than 4.1, you need to install:

     yum install libbcc libbcc-examples python-bcc

This script has been tested with a 4.3.3 kernel.
